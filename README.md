# Probelm or Urgency 
The amount of malware is increasing every year and poses a serious global security threat. Traditional-based detection is the most widely used commercial antivirus method, however, it consistently fails to detect new malware.

# Solution as a Project
We propose a new method of malware protection that adopts a semi-supervised learning approach to detect unknown malware. This method is designed to build a machine-learning classifier using a set of labeled (malware and legitimate software) and unlabeled instances.

# Objectives
1. Advancements in detecting malware signatures through machine learning techniques.
2. To design a model that uses semi-supervised machine learning techniques on API call logs to identify malware in Android Apps.
3. To broaden our understanding of semi-supervised learning methodologies by including more algorithms in our research.
4. To Lessen the time-consuming process of analysis that is done by the classic signature methods earlier.
